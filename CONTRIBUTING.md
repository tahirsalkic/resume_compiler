## PR Rules

### 1. Pull Request title
As described [here](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json), a valid PR title should begin with one of the following prefixes:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

For example, a PR title could be:
- `refactor: modify package path`
- `feat(ai): xxxx`, where `(ai)` means that this PR mainly focuses on the ai component.

You may also check out previous PRs in the [PR list](https://github.com/tahirsalkic/resume_compiler/pulls).

### 2. Pull Request description
- If your PR is small (such as a typo fix), you can go brief.
- If it contains a lot of changes, it's better to write more details.
